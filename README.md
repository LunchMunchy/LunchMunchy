👋 Call me LunchMunchy.

Wall-fly'd around tech for too long. It's time to start adding value.

I perpetually feel like a Junior 🌱 in all things cyber \
But focus is Cloud Engineering + DevSecOps ☁️☁️☁️ \

My biggest side project is still a brain child. \
It's an non-social network networking app. \
Let's talk! DM me about it @HeyPaulTan.
