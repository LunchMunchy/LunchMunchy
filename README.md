👋 Hi, I’m @LunchMunchy. I've always wall-fly'd around the tech community. But I feel like it time to start adding value.

Still feel like a Junior 🌱 in all things cyber. \
Focusing on Cloud Engineering + DevSecOps ☁️☁️☁️ \
(It's all about that #100DaysOfKubernetes game) \

My biggest side project is still a brain child. \
It's an non-social network networking app. \
Come talk to me about it @HeyPaulTan!
